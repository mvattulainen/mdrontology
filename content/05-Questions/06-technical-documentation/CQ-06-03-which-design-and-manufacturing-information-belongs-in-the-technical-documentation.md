# Which design and manufacturing information belongs in the technical documentation?

> [!summary] Manufacturer answer
> Assemble this answer from the graph and expose missing facts; do not infer absent device data.

## Required context

- `configuration_baseline`
- `lifecycle_state`
- `technical_documentation`

## Ontology path

`DeviceConfiguration → DesignOutput/ManufacturingProcess/Site/Supplier → TechnicalDocumentationSection`


## Answer

The technical documentation should include the design stages and specifications, manufacturing processes and validation, production and test sites, and controlled supplier information needed to understand and verify how the configuration is realized. The ontology connects each configuration to those design outputs, processes, sites and suppliers and assigns them to the appropriate documentation sections.

## Infusion-pump example context

This competency question is grounded in the imaginary Infpump FlowGuard device context [[06-Infpump FlowGuard ontology notes/device-configuration/DEVC-PUMP-003-infpump-flowguard-paediatric-configuration-10|DEVC-PUMP-003]] and the following device-specific ontology notes:

- [[06-Infpump FlowGuard ontology notes/document-version/DOC-PUMP-003-risk-management-file-rev-d|DOC-PUMP-003 — Risk management file Rev D]]
- [[06-Infpump FlowGuard ontology notes/device-configuration/DEVC-PUMP-003-infpump-flowguard-paediatric-configuration-10|DEVC-PUMP-003 — Infpump FlowGuard paediatric configuration 1.0]]

Follow the linked note to its technical-file name, record identifier, relationships and review boundary before synthesising an answer.
## Related entities

Start from the resolved `device-configuration`.
