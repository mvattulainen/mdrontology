# What does the manufacturer's SRN identify and where is it used?

> [!summary] Manufacturer answer
> Assemble this answer from the graph and expose missing facts; do not infer absent device data.

## Required context

- `manufacturer`
- `device_identity`
- `market`
- `relevant_date`

## Ontology path

`EconomicOperator → ActorRegistration → SRN → RegulatorySubmission/Registration`


## Answer

The SRN uniquely identifies a registered manufacturer, authorised representative or importer as an economic operator in EUDAMED and is reused in relevant registrations, certificates and regulatory submissions where required. The ontology links the economic operator to its validated actor registration and SRN and then to each submission or registration that uses it.

## Infusion-pump example context

This competency question is grounded in the imaginary Infpump FlowGuard device context [[06-Infpump FlowGuard ontology notes/device-configuration/DEVC-PUMP-004-infpump-flowguard-oncology-configuration-11|DEVC-PUMP-004]] and the following device-specific ontology note:

- [[06-Infpump FlowGuard ontology notes/device-configuration/DEVC-PUMP-004-infpump-flowguard-oncology-configuration-11|DEVC-PUMP-004 — Infpump FlowGuard oncology configuration 1.1]]

Follow the linked note to its technical-file name, record identifier, relationships and review boundary before synthesising an answer.
## Related entities

Start from the resolved `device-configuration`.
