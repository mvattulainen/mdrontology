# Which manufacturer-controlled facts must be available for importer verification?

> [!summary] Manufacturer answer
> Assemble this answer from the graph and expose missing facts; do not infer absent device data.

## Required context

- `manufacturer`
- `device_identity`
- `market`
- `relevant_date`

## Ontology path

`ImporterVerificationRequirement → Device/Label/CE/DoC/Registration → Evidence/VerificationRecord`


## Answer

The importer must be able to verify, before placing the device on the market, the CE marking, required declaration and conformity assessment, manufacturer and authorised representative details where applicable, labelling and IFU, UDI assignment where applicable, and registration-related conditions. The ontology turns those manufacturer-controlled device facts into a verification requirement and retains the evidence and importer verification record.

## Infusion-pump example context

This competency question is grounded in the imaginary Infpump FlowGuard device context [[06-Infpump FlowGuard ontology notes/device-configuration/DEVC-PUMP-001-infpump-flowguard-bedside-configuration-10|DEVC-PUMP-001]] and the following device-specific ontology notes:

- [[06-Infpump FlowGuard ontology notes/component/COMP-PUMP-006-alarm-speaker-assembly|COMP-PUMP-006 — Alarm speaker assembly]]
- [[06-Infpump FlowGuard ontology notes/device-configuration/DEVC-PUMP-001-infpump-flowguard-bedside-configuration-10|DEVC-PUMP-001 — Infpump FlowGuard bedside configuration 1.0]]

Follow the linked note to its technical-file name, record identifier, relationships and review boundary before synthesising an answer.
