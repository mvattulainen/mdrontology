# Which devices and intended purposes require a clinical evaluation?

> [!summary] Manufacturer answer
> Assemble this answer from the graph and expose missing facts; do not infer absent device data.

## Required context

- `intended_purpose`
- `clinical_claims`
- `risk_class`
- `clinical_evidence`

## Ontology path

`DeviceConfiguration → IntendedPurpose → ClinicalEvaluationRequirement → ClinicalEvaluation`


## Answer

Every medical device requires a planned, conducted and documented clinical evaluation appropriate to its intended purpose throughout its lifecycle. The ontology links each device configuration and intended purpose to the clinical-evaluation requirement and to the controlled evaluation that supplies the evidence and conclusions for that scope.

## Infusion-pump example context

This competency question is grounded in the imaginary Infpump FlowGuard device context [[06-Infpump FlowGuard ontology notes/device-configuration/DEVC-PUMP-001-infpump-flowguard-bedside-configuration-10|DEVC-PUMP-001]] and the following device-specific ontology notes:

- [[06-Infpump FlowGuard ontology notes/clinical-evaluation/CE-PUMP-001-infpump-flowguard-continuous-clinical-evaluation|CE-PUMP-001 — Infpump FlowGuard continuous clinical evaluation]]
- [[06-Infpump FlowGuard ontology notes/device-configuration/DEVC-PUMP-001-infpump-flowguard-bedside-configuration-10|DEVC-PUMP-001 — Infpump FlowGuard bedside configuration 1.0]]
