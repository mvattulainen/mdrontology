# When can published literature contribute enough evidence without a new clinical investigation?

> [!summary] Manufacturer answer
> Assemble this answer from the graph and expose missing facts; do not infer absent device data.

## Required context

- `intended_purpose`
- `clinical_claims`
- `risk_class`
- `clinical_evidence`

## Ontology path

`ClinicalClaim → LiteratureEvidence → Relevance/Quality/Applicability → EvidenceSufficiency → InvestigationNeed`


## Answer

Published literature can be sufficient when it is relevant to the subject device and claims, methodologically credible, applicable to the intended population and use, and collectively adequate to address the identified evidence needs. The ontology appraises literature against relevance, quality and applicability, derives evidence sufficiency and records a clinical-investigation need where material gaps remain.

## Infusion-pump example context

This competency question is grounded in the imaginary Infpump FlowGuard device context [[06-Infpump FlowGuard ontology notes/device-configuration/DEVC-PUMP-003-infpump-flowguard-paediatric-configuration-10|DEVC-PUMP-003]] and the following device-specific ontology notes:

- [[06-Infpump FlowGuard ontology notes/clinical-evaluation-report/CER-PUMP-001-infpump-flowguard-clinical-evaluation-report-rev-d|CER-PUMP-001 — Infpump FlowGuard clinical evaluation report Rev D]]
- [[06-Infpump FlowGuard ontology notes/device-configuration/DEVC-PUMP-003-infpump-flowguard-paediatric-configuration-10|DEVC-PUMP-003 — Infpump FlowGuard paediatric configuration 1.0]]
