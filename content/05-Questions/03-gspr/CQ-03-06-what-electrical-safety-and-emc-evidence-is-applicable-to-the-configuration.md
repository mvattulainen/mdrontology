# What electrical-safety and EMC evidence is applicable to the configuration?

> [!summary] Manufacturer answer
> Assemble this answer from the graph and expose missing facts; do not infer absent device data.

## Required context

- `intended_purpose`
- `risk_class`
- `configuration_baseline`

## Ontology path

`DeviceConfiguration → ElectricalCharacteristic/Environment → RequirementInstance → Standard/TestPlan → TestReport`


## Answer

Applicable electrical-safety and EMC evidence is determined by the configuration’s electrical characteristics, accessories, power modes and intended electromagnetic environment, and must cover the released configuration. The ontology creates the relevant requirement instances, links selected standards and test plans, and requires corresponding controlled test reports with configuration coverage.

## Infusion-pump example context

This competency question is grounded in the imaginary Infpump FlowGuard device context [[06-Infpump FlowGuard ontology notes/device-configuration/DEVC-PUMP-001-infpump-flowguard-bedside-configuration-10|DEVC-PUMP-001]] and the following device-specific ontology notes:

- [[06-Infpump FlowGuard ontology notes/risk-control-measure/RCM-PUMP-026-signed-software-update-packages|RCM-PUMP-026 — Signed software update packages]]
- [[06-Infpump FlowGuard ontology notes/device-configuration/DEVC-PUMP-001-infpump-flowguard-bedside-configuration-10|DEVC-PUMP-001 — Infpump FlowGuard bedside configuration 1.0]]
