# Does this product fall within the MDR medical-device concept for the intended EU use?

> [!summary] Manufacturer answer
> Assemble this answer from the graph and expose missing facts; do not infer absent device data.

## Required context

- `intended_purpose`
- `manufacturer`
- `market`
- `relevant_date`

## Ontology path

`DeviceCandidate → IntendedPurpose → ModeOfAction → RegulatoryDefinition → QualificationDecision`


## Answer

The product falls within the MDR medical-device concept only if its controlled intended purpose is medical and its principal intended action is not achieved by pharmacological, immunological or metabolic means, although those means may assist its function. The ontology therefore resolves the device candidate through its intended purpose and mode of action, compares those facts with the regulatory definition, and records the result as a reviewed qualification decision.

## Infusion-pump example context

This competency question is grounded in the imaginary Infpump FlowGuard device context [[06-Infpump FlowGuard ontology notes/device-configuration/DEVC-PUMP-001-infpump-flowguard-bedside-configuration-10|DEVC-PUMP-001]] and the following device-specific ontology notes:

- [[06-Infpump FlowGuard ontology notes/intended-purpose/IP-PUMP-001-controlled-infusion-of-prescribed-fluids-for-adult-inpatients|IP-PUMP-001 — Controlled infusion of prescribed fluids for adult inpatients]]
- [[06-Infpump FlowGuard ontology notes/device-configuration/DEVC-PUMP-001-infpump-flowguard-bedside-configuration-10|DEVC-PUMP-001 — Infpump FlowGuard bedside configuration 1.0]]
