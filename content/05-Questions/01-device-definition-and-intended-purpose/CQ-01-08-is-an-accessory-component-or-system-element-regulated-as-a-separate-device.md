# Is an accessory, component or system element regulated as a separate device?

> [!summary] Manufacturer answer
> Assemble this answer from the graph and expose missing facts; do not infer absent device data.

## Required context

- `intended_purpose`
- `manufacturer`
- `market`
- `relevant_date`

## Ontology path

`ProductElement → Function → IntendedPurpose → AccessoryDefinition/DeviceDefinition → QualificationDecision`


## Answer

A product element is regulated separately only when its own function and manufacturer-stated intended purpose satisfy the MDR definition of a device or accessory; being physically connected to a system is not sufficient by itself. The ontology evaluates the element’s function and purpose against the accessory and device definitions and records the outcome in a qualification decision.

## Infusion-pump example context

This competency question is grounded in the imaginary Infpump FlowGuard device context [[06-Infpump FlowGuard ontology notes/device-configuration/DEVC-PUMP-003-infpump-flowguard-paediatric-configuration-10|DEVC-PUMP-003]] and the following device-specific ontology note:

- [[06-Infpump FlowGuard ontology notes/device-configuration/DEVC-PUMP-003-infpump-flowguard-paediatric-configuration-10|DEVC-PUMP-003 — Infpump FlowGuard paediatric configuration 1.0]]

Follow the linked note to its technical-file name, record identifier, relationships and review boundary before synthesising an answer.
