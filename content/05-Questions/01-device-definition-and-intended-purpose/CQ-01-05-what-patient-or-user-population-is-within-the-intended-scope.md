# What patient or user population is within the intended scope?

> [!summary] Manufacturer answer
> Assemble this answer from the graph and expose missing facts; do not infer absent device data.

## Required context

- `intended_purpose`
- `manufacturer`
- `market`
- `relevant_date`

## Ontology path

`IntendedPurpose → TargetPopulation → Inclusion/ExclusionCharacteristic → ClinicalEvidence → Risk`


## Answer

The intended population consists of the patients and users expressly included by the controlled intended purpose, subject to recorded exclusion characteristics, contraindications and use limitations. The ontology derives that scope through the TargetPopulation and inclusion/exclusion nodes, then checks that clinical evidence and risk analysis support the population actually claimed.

## Infusion-pump example context

This competency question is grounded in the imaginary Infpump FlowGuard device context [[06-Infpump FlowGuard ontology notes/device-configuration/DEVC-PUMP-005-infpump-flowguard-critical-care-configuration-11|DEVC-PUMP-005]] and the following device-specific ontology note:

- [[06-Infpump FlowGuard ontology notes/device-configuration/DEVC-PUMP-005-infpump-flowguard-critical-care-configuration-11|DEVC-PUMP-005 — Infpump FlowGuard critical-care configuration 1.1]]

Follow the linked note to its technical-file name, record identifier, relationships and review boundary before synthesising an answer.
