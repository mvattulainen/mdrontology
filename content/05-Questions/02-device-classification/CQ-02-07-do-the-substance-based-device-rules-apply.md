# Do the substance-based device rules apply?

> [!summary] Manufacturer answer
> Assemble this answer from the graph and expose missing facts; do not infer absent device data.

## Required context

- `intended_purpose`
- `duration`
- `invasiveness`
- `active_characteristic`
- `software_function`

## Ontology path

`DeviceConfiguration → SubstanceComposition/Administration/Absorption/Dispersion → Rule21Assessment`


## Answer

The substance-based rules apply only when the configuration is composed of substances or combinations of substances intended to be introduced through a body orifice or applied to skin and then absorbed by, or locally dispersed in, the human body. The ontology checks composition, administration route, absorption and dispersion and records a Rule 21 assessment rather than inferring applicability from the presence of any substance.

## Infusion-pump example context

This competency question is grounded in the imaginary Infpump FlowGuard device context [[06-Infpump FlowGuard ontology notes/device-configuration/DEVC-PUMP-002-infpump-flowguard-transport-configuration-10|DEVC-PUMP-002]] and the following device-specific ontology notes:

- [[06-Infpump FlowGuard ontology notes/classification-decision/CLD-PUMP-002-transport-configuration-classification-decision|CLD-PUMP-002 — Transport configuration classification decision]]
- [[06-Infpump FlowGuard ontology notes/device-configuration/DEVC-PUMP-002-infpump-flowguard-transport-configuration-10|DEVC-PUMP-002 — Infpump FlowGuard transport configuration 1.0]]
