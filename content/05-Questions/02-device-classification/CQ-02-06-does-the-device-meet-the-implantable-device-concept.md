# Does the device meet the implantable-device concept?

> [!summary] Manufacturer answer
> Assemble this answer from the graph and expose missing facts; do not infer absent device data.

## Required context

- `intended_purpose`
- `duration`
- `invasiveness`
- `active_characteristic`
- `software_function`

## Ontology path

`DeviceConfiguration → Placement/Duration/Removal → ImplantableCharacteristic → ClassificationRule`


## Answer

The device meets the implantable concept only if it is intended to be totally introduced into the human body, replace an epithelial surface or eye surface as specified, and remain in place after the procedure, including a partially introduced device intended to remain for at least 30 days where the definition applies. The ontology assesses placement, duration and removal for the configuration before assigning the implantable characteristic and rule.

## Infusion-pump example context

This competency question is grounded in the imaginary Infpump FlowGuard device context [[06-Infpump FlowGuard ontology notes/device-configuration/DEVC-PUMP-001-infpump-flowguard-bedside-configuration-10|DEVC-PUMP-001]] and the following device-specific ontology notes:

- [[06-Infpump FlowGuard ontology notes/classification-decision/CLD-PUMP-001-bedside-configuration-classification-decision|CLD-PUMP-001 — Bedside configuration classification decision]]
- [[06-Infpump FlowGuard ontology notes/device-configuration/DEVC-PUMP-001-infpump-flowguard-bedside-configuration-10|DEVC-PUMP-001 — Infpump FlowGuard bedside configuration 1.0]]
