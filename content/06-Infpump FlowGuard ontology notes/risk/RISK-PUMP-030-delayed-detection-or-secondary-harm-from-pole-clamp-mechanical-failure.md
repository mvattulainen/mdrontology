## Traceability

Previous dependencies are ontology notes that lead into this record. They reach it through `has_risk` from [[06-Infpump FlowGuard ontology notes/device-configuration/DEVC-PUMP-004-infpump-flowguard-oncology-configuration-11|DEVC-PUMP-004 — Infpump FlowGuard oncology configuration 1.1]]; `mitigates` from [[06-Infpump FlowGuard ontology notes/risk-control-measure/RCM-PUMP-030-safe-state-after-communication-loss|RCM-PUMP-030 — Safe state after communication loss]]. These incoming links show which product, decision, process or evidence records depend on the current note.

Succeeding dependencies are ontology notes to which this record leads. The trace continues through `concerns` to [[06-Infpump FlowGuard ontology notes/device-configuration/DEVC-PUMP-005-infpump-flowguard-critical-care-configuration-11|DEVC-PUMP-005 — Infpump FlowGuard critical-care configuration 1.1]]. These outgoing links identify the next product, risk, control, evidence, change or lifecycle records used by downstream reasoning.

The left-to-right diagram shows up to five asserted previous and five asserted succeeding ontology-note dependencies. When more links exist, the additional-dependency node states how many remain available through the verbal links and structured metadata above.
