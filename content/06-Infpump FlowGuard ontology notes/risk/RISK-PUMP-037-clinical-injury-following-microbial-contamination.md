## Traceability

Previous dependencies are ontology notes that lead into this record. They reach it through `has_risk` from [[06-Infpump FlowGuard ontology notes/device-configuration/DEVC-PUMP-005-infpump-flowguard-critical-care-configuration-11|DEVC-PUMP-005 — Infpump FlowGuard critical-care configuration 1.1]]; `mitigates` from [[06-Infpump FlowGuard ontology notes/risk-control-measure/RCM-PUMP-037-temperature-monitoring|RCM-PUMP-037 — Temperature monitoring]]. These incoming links show which product, decision, process or evidence records depend on the current note.

Succeeding dependencies are ontology notes to which this record leads. The trace continues through `concerns` to [[06-Infpump FlowGuard ontology notes/device-configuration/DEVC-PUMP-002-infpump-flowguard-transport-configuration-10|DEVC-PUMP-002 — Infpump FlowGuard transport configuration 1.0]]. These outgoing links identify the next product, risk, control, evidence, change or lifecycle records used by downstream reasoning.

The left-to-right diagram shows up to five asserted previous and five asserted succeeding ontology-note dependencies. When more links exist, the additional-dependency node states how many remain available through the verbal links and structured metadata above.
