# Clinical evaluations identify evaluated configurations

## Explanation

This constraint requires a clinical evaluation to identify the device configuration or configurations it evaluates. Making that scope explicit prevents clinical conclusions from being silently generalized to variants, accessories or versions that were not part of the documented evaluation.

## Assurance

- Level: `advisory`
- Normative basis: `ontology-governance`
- Failure effect: non-blocking advisory finding requiring review

```yaml ontology-constraint
{
  "target_type": "clinical-evaluation",
  "checks": [
    {
      "relation": "evaluates",
      "min": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

This constraint page is connected to a concrete Infpump FlowGuard ontology note so its terminology or contract can be inspected in device-specific context.
