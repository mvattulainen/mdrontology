# PMS plans identify monitored configurations

## Explanation

This constraint checks that each PMS plan identifies the device configurations it monitors. Explicit configuration scope helps ensure that complaints, trend data, signals and periodic reporting are interpreted for the correct marketed population rather than for an undefined product family.

## Assurance

- Level: `advisory`
- Normative basis: `ontology-governance`
- Failure effect: non-blocking advisory finding requiring review

```yaml ontology-constraint
{
  "target_type": "pms-plan",
  "checks": [
    {
      "relation": "applies_to_configuration",
      "min": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

## Infusion-pump ontology-note example

This constraint page is connected to a concrete Infpump FlowGuard ontology note so its terminology or contract can be inspected in device-specific context.
